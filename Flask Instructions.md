Please note that I have used github LFS in order to upload the model pkl file, and it may cause problems if you directly fork the repository. 
In that case, it is also on drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q2VjIPYjiaBZrpOLiDnCjIQy2sDr1GUc/view?usp=sharing

Instructions (if getting from drive)

Download the .zip file.
Extract the Spotify(2) Folder.
Download Spotipy library (pip install spotipy) before running the flask application.
Run app.py
NOTE: Make sure rfc.pkl is there in the folder, .pkl file will be generated after running the .ipynb project file.
